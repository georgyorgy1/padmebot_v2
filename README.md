# PadmeBot Version 2.11

Current Build Tag: 20171221-1739

Welcome to PadmeBot v2.11

What is PadmeBot?
PadmeBot is a shitposting bot based on AestheticsBot and inspired by MarcyBot. The original PadmeBot codebase was so hard to maintain that a new one had to be written.

What's amazing about this version is that the bot is now modular. That's right! You can take any module (pad(module name/feature)lib.py) and then implement it in your own bot (whether it's a Discord bot, an IRC bot or an Ajax bot). Heck, you can even use it for almost anything (desktop gui software, cli software, etc.).

## Installation
Copy the token ID of your bot and paste it in cred.txt. After that, launch main.py

## Here are the working commands (for now):

$checkem - generate random post digits (you might get doubles)

$daisy - get a link to the cringiest story I've ever written

big guy - 4u

garlic - bread

anakin - This gives PadmeBot an orgasm

weed - DUDE WEED LMAO

lol - get lol pics

$rand32 / $random - generate a random 32 bit number

$rand64 - generate a random 64 bit number

$sin (number) - get the sin value of a number

$tan (number) - get the tan value of a number
