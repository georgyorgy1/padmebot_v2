# PadmeBot Version 2.1
Welcome to PadmeBot v2.1

What is PadmeBot?
PadmeBot is a shitposting bot based on AestheticsBot and inspired by MarcyBot. The original PadmeBot's codebase is so hard to maintain that a new one had to be written.

Here are the working commands (for now):
$checkem - generate random post digits (you might get doubles)
$daisy - get a link to the cringiest story I've ever written
big guy - 4u
garlic - bread
anakin - This gives PadmeBot an orgasm
$rand32 / $random - generate a random 32 bit number
$rand64 - generate a random 64 bit number
$sin <number> - get the sin value of a number
$cos <number> - get the cos value of a number
$tan <number> - get the tan value of a number
$weight <mass in kg> - get the weight of a certain mass in Newtons

Upcoming features/features to be reimplemented:
$anime <category> - get a random anime based on your category
$selfbot <username> - get random quotes from a user in the server
$createselfbot <username> - creates a selfbot for a certain user
$memes - get memes
